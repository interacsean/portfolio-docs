### Home page design and interaction ###

White ? large text menu items, centered.  ~5px vertical colourful line next to each.  

On mouse-over, line animates into box / shape with icon in it.

On-click/-tap, other menu items shoot off-screen to the left, or they swipe into the coloured line.  This could occur in a cascading fashion.

The clicked menu item shoots off-screen to the right (Or text stays static?), followed by the coloured line which expands and leaves a long blurred colored trail.  As the colour hits the right side of the screen, it reappears top-left, at a larger height, and creates a new heading, either revealing it as it swipes across the screen, or the text follows.

### Content page ###

On largish (tablet+) devices, full-screen type interface with 1:2 (2/3rds) vertical split of the screen.  This can alternate between █▒▒ and ▒▒█

One side will be text description and the other will be images of the project.  Text to be scrollable.  At the edge of the content area there will be triangle arrows which protrude over the image area to indicate relevance of the current image.  The images will change based on the user-scrolling and (ostensibly) the arrows coming into view.

Probably include the ability to change images with swipe left-right / slide-show dots.  This could automatically scroll the text to the relevant position(?)

A menu-button will be available with side-menu-like navigation to go back to home, or jump to a project or other main menu area.
