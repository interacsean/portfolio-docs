## Purpose ##

My portfolio should allow recruiters and potential employers understand my skills, abilities and experience as quickly as possible, and give quick access to contact me

Language used will be inclusive of people with a limited to moderate understanding of webdev technology.  Some detail areas will include lower-level technical descriptions, but the overall communication must target a broader audience.

## Technical goals ##

The project should use:

 - React web framework
 - ES6 2015 (transpiled)
 - Webpack (or similar)
 - Be tracked through git
 - Use SCSS for management of stylesheet
 - Use BEM or similiar class/style naming conventions
 - Minimalist approach to site download size.
   - This will be done through use of speed analysis tools such as Google Chrome's dev-tools
   - Use of libraries and react plugins will be ruthlessly constrained, and considered in regards to value added to the overall site vs increase in download size.
   - Where a feature of a library could be utilised, I will copy / paste / 'use as inspiration' the relevant code (if allowed) into my own plugin or library in order to reduce unnecessary overhead that comes with including whole libraries
   - Goal is for first-load html, css + js (minus react base libraries) to be < 250kb.
